# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This project was completed for the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to use SVG and Inquirer to allow the user to create simple logos based on a series of prompts. This project also used test cases to ensure that the code was working as intended.

## Installation

Download the application from this GitHub page and install dependencies. Run "npm init -y", "npm install inquirer@8.2.4", and "npm install jest" in your terminal. 

## Usage

To start the application, run "node index.js" in your terminal and follow the series of prompts. After the SVG file is generated, open the file in a live server or in your browser to see the created logo.

## Credits

I referenced previous projects and examples from the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp to assist in creating this page.

## Features

The application allows the creation of logos based on responses to Inquirer prompts. The user can enter a string of text up to 3 characters long, the color of the text, the shape of the logo, and the color of the shape. Users will be able to see this logo by opening the newly-created SVG file in a live server or browser.
